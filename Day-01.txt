01.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?
    HTTP/1.1 handles web requests and responses one at a time. It's like asking for each piece of a website separately â€“ the text, the images, and other elements. This can make loading websites take longer, especially when there are many things to fetch.

    HTTP/2 is allows your web browser to request and receive multiple elements of a website at the same time. This makes everything load much faster because you don't have to wait for one thing to finish before asking for the next.

    Key Differences:

01.Multiplexing:
    HTTP/1.1: Processes requests and responses one at a time.

    HTTP/2: Handles multiple requests and responses simultaneously, like our magic library card.

02.Header Compression:
    HTTP/1.1: Sends a lot of repeated information, making requests and responses larger.

    HTTP/2: Compresses headers, reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent back and forth.

03.Prioritization:
    03.HTTP/1.1: Doesn't have a built-in way to prioritize which elements of a webpage are more important.

    HTTP/2: Allows for prioritizing content, ensuring the essential stuff loads first.

04.Binary Protocol:
    HTTP/1.1: Uses plain text for communication.

    HTTP/2: Uses binary code, which computers find easier and faster to understand.
